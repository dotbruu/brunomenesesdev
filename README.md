Hello 👋!

My name is Bruno Meneses, and I am a full stack software developer specializing in programming languages like JavaScript and TypeScript. I have a passion for creating a better future through technology.

As a developer, I have a strong experience in NodeJS 💪 and advocate for the principles of scalable architecture. I am constantly seeking innovative technological solutions that can transform how companies interact with their customers and maximize their results.

I am dedicated to creating high-quality solutions that help companies stand out in their markets. I firmly believe in the power of technology to drive business growth, which is why I strive to develop innovative and scalable solutions that meet the needs of clients.

Software architecture 📝 is an area that fascinates me, and I make it a point to apply best practices in my daily work to make systems more robust and easy to maintain.
